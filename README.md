# Data-Analyst-Intern-at-Elevate-Labs-Task-6
In this task, I conducted a professional sales trend analysis using an e-commerce dataset to evaluate monthly revenue and order volume. I formulated a MySQL query that extracts the year and month, aggregates total revenue using SUM, and computes order volume using COUNT(DISTINCT order_id), grouping and ordering the results by month. I then simulated the execution of this query and produced a monthly summary table, which highlighted fluctuations in revenue and volume across the year. The final outcome includes a fully prepared SQL script and a detailed analytical summary.
